    This is a socket that reliably transports messages.

    Description:
        This socket uses a UDP socket and builds reliability on top of it. For
        each message transport, this class maintains a ReliableMessageSender and
        a ReliableMessageReceiver that implement the reliable transport logic.
        ReliableMessageSender and ReliableMessageReceiver are implemented in 
        reliable_transmission.py

    APIs:
        ReliableSocket.send(receiver_addr, message)
            Sends a message to an address
        ReliableSocket.recvfrom()
            Receives a message sent to the socket

        Note:
            If optional args block is true and timeout is None (the default), it
            blocks if necessary until a message is received. If timeout is a positive
            number, it blocks at most timeout seconds and raises the queue.Empty
            exception if no message is received within that time. Otherwise (block is
            false), return a received message if one is immediately available, else
